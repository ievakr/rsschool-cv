### About Me ###

**Profile**: I have interest in three subjects: Web development, game development or cyber security, therefore I applied for these courses to gain some experience, that can be useful for one of these fields. Until this time I was practicing HTML and CSS on my own by watching Youtube videos and reading Mozilla Development Network tutorials. Now I am working as a technical writer, where I also have to use Markdown, HTML and CSS to write documents but I want to deeper my knowledge and step-up my career.  

**Skills**: Markdown, HTML, CSS, JSON.   

**Experience**: For 6 months I have been writing technical documentation using the **LaRecipe** package and writing examples in JSON on how to configure the software for insurance companies. In my free time I am developing a cat webpage, the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ievakr/catpage) (The page is in Lithuanian and it is not finished).  

**Education**: Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering.  

**Language Skills**: English is in full professional proficiency. I have been working as technical writer for almost 6 years, where the texts were written in English.
